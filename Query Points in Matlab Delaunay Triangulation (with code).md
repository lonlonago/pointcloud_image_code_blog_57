   Returns a column vector of logical values that indicates whether a triangle in a 2D constrained Delaunay triangulation is within a bounded geometric domain. The element of TF is 1 (true) when the corresponding triangle in DT is within that domain, and 0 (false) otherwise. 

#  Code example 

 Triangle within the specified boundary, computes and plots the constrained two-dimensional Delaunay triangulation of the triangle within the specified boundary.

    Constraints between vertices (V1, V3) have been followed, but the Delaunay rule is invalidated. In addition, the nearest neighbor relationship inherent in Delaunay triangulation is invalidated. This means that if the triangulation contains constraints, the nearestNeighbor search method provided by delaunayTriangulation cannot be supported.
